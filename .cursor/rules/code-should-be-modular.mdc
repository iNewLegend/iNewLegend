# Code should be modulart

- Prefer generic way of handling things
- Take into account that most of the components should be reusble in other projects, this will help you to get a conclusion if the current code should be context aware or not
- more agnostic approach to further improve reusability. change it to something that better represents its purpose without implementation-specific terminology
