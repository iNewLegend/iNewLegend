# Data Engineering — Services

* **DBT (Data Build Tool)** — Is an open-source data transformation tool that enables analysts and data engineers to transform, model, and manage data in the data warehouse using **SQL**.
    * **DBT** is often used in modern data engineering workflows to create and maintain clean, reliable datasets in data warehouses like **Snowflake**, **BigQuery**, or **Redshift**.
      <br /><br />
* **Snowflake** — Is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that enables organizations to store, process, and analyze large volumes of data. It is designed for scalability, performance, and ease of use, making it popular for data analytics and data engineering.
  <br /><br />
* **Apache Airflow** — Is an open-source platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It is commonly used for orchestrating complex data pipelines and automating tasks in data engineering.
  <br /><br />
* **Kafka** — Is a [distributed](dictionary.md#distributed) event streaming platform used in data engineering for:
    * Real-time data pipelines and streaming analytics
    * High-throughput, fault-tolerant data ingestion
    * Decoupling data streams between systems or applications
    * Storing and processing streams of records
