## Reconcile — `rec·on·cile`
Reconcile is a verb associated with restoring harmony or making things compatible. It's used in various contexts, including interpersonal relationships, financial accounting, and programming.

### Non-Technical Interpretation {id="non-technical-interpretation_1"}
In daily life, reconciliation might occur between friends who, after a disagreement, discuss their issues, reach common understanding, and repair their relationship. In finance, it could refer to an individual or company cross-verifying their records with bank statements to ensure all transactions are accounted for.

### Example (Non-Programming Context) {id="example-non-programming-context_1"}

Suppose two individuals, Alex and Taylor, were great friends but had a major disagreement that led to a bitter fallout. After some time, they both realize the value of their friendship and decide to reconcile.

**Issue**: The disagreement led to hurt feelings and misunderstandings that disrupted the harmonious relationship between Alex and Taylor.

**Reconciliation Process**: Alex and Taylor decide to meet and discuss their misunderstanding. They each share their perspectives on the disagreement:

1. They discuss the issues that led to their fallout, expressing their feelings, highlighting misunderstandings, and explaining their actions since the disagreement.
2. They then listen to each other's viewpoints, making efforts to understand and remember the other person's feelings and perspectives.

The process concludes with both Alex and Taylor agreeing to forgive each other, forget the past differences, and focus on preserving their friendship in the future. They make compromises where necessary and promise to respect each other's viewpoints moving forward, thus successfully reconciling their relationship.

### Technical Interpretation {id="technical-interpretation_1"}
In a programming context, particularly in languages like **JavaScript**, reconciliation refers to the harmonization of two data sets to ensure they match. It is crucial in tasks like database management.

In JavaScript libraries like **React**, it describes how **React** updates the **DOM**. The process involves comparing the new **VirtualDOM** with the previously rendered one and only updating elements that have changed.

### Example (Programming Context) {id="example-programming-context_1"}
Consider two copies of a document:
1. `Server copy` - located on a remote server.
2. `Local copy` - stored on your device for offline editing.

**Issue**: After making changes to the local copy offline, these changes need updating on the server copy once your device is online. However, other users may have made independent changes on the server copy during this offline period.

**Reconciliation Solution**: The software compares changes in both copies to reconcile them:
1. If changes are unrelated (i.e., different parts of the document changed), the software applies changes to both copies.
2. In case of a conflict (i.e., same document part modified), the software could:
    - Accept the most recent change.
    - Show the user a comparison and let them manually resolve the conflict.
