# Microfrontend

## Microfrontend — `my-kroh-frun-tend`

**Microfrontend** is a [noun](../dictionary/overview#noun) in software architecture that refers to a design approach where a frontend application is decomposed into smaller, independent applications that can be developed, deployed, and maintained by separate teams.

### Non-Technical Interpretation

In everyday life, a microfrontend can be compared to a shopping mall where different stores operate independently but share common infrastructure like parking, security, and utilities. Each store has its own management, products, and operations, but they all contribute to the overall mall experience.

### Example (Non-Programming Context)

Consider a large department store chain:
**Microfrontend Analogy**:

1. **Independent Sections**: Each department (electronics, clothing, home goods) operates with its own staff, inventory, and management.
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: All departments share the same building, security system, payment processing, and customer service.
3. **Unified Experience**: Customers can move between departments seamlessly, with consistent branding and navigation.
4. **Independent Operations**: Each department can update its layout, products, or policies without affecting other departments.

### Technical Interpretation

In web development, microfrontends break down monolithic frontend applications into smaller, self-contained applications that communicate through well-defined interfaces. Each microfrontend can be built with different technologies, deployed independently, and maintained by separate teams.

### Example (Programming Context)

Consider an e-commerce platform with multiple microfrontends:
**E-commerce Microfrontend Architecture**:

1. **Product Catalog**: Built with React, handles product browsing and search.
2. **Shopping Cart**: Built with Vue.js, manages cart operations and checkout.
3. **User Profile**: Built with Angular, handles user authentication and preferences.
4. **Recommendations**: Built with Svelte, provides personalized product suggestions.

```typescript
// Main application shell
class AppShell {
  private microfrontends: Map<string, Microfrontend> = new Map();

  registerMicrofrontend(name: string, microfrontend: Microfrontend) {
    this.microfrontends.set(name, microfrontend);
  }

  renderMicrofrontend(name: string, container: HTMLElement) {
    const microfrontend = this.microfrontends.get(name);
    if (microfrontend) {
      microfrontend.mount(container);
    }
  }
}

// Microfrontend interface
interface Microfrontend {
  mount(container: HTMLElement): void;
  unmount(): void;
  updateProps(props: Record<string, unknown>): void;
}

// Product catalog microfrontend
class ProductCatalogMicrofrontend implements Microfrontend {
  mount(container: HTMLElement) {
    // Mount React application
    container.innerHTML = '<div id="product-catalog"></div>';
  }

  unmount() {
    // Cleanup React application
  }

  updateProps(props: Record<string, unknown>) {
    // Update React component props
  }
}
```

## Key Characteristics

### 1. **Independent Deployment**

Each microfrontend can be deployed independently without affecting other parts of the application.

### 2. **Technology Diversity**

Different microfrontends can use different frameworks, libraries, or even programming languages.

### 3. **Team Autonomy**

Each team can work independently on their microfrontend without coordination with other teams.

### 4. **Shared Infrastructure**

Common services like authentication, routing, and state management are shared across microfrontends.

## Benefits

### 1. **Scalability**

Teams can scale independently based on their microfrontend's requirements.

### 2. **Technology Flexibility**

Teams can choose the best technology stack for their specific use case.

### 3. **Faster Development**

Smaller, focused teams can develop and deploy features more quickly.

### 4. **Risk Isolation**

Issues in one microfrontend don't affect the entire application.

## Challenges

### 1. **Complexity**

Managing multiple applications and their interactions can be complex.

### 2. **Consistency**

Maintaining consistent user experience across different microfrontends can be challenging.

### 3. **Performance**

Loading multiple applications can impact performance if not optimized properly.

### 4. **Communication**

Microfrontends need to communicate effectively while maintaining independence.

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. **Module Federation**

Using Webpack Module Federation to share code between microfrontends.

### 2. **Single-SPA**

A framework for building microfrontends that can coexist on the same page.

### 3. **Iframe-based**

Using iframes to isolate microfrontends completely.

### 4. **Web Components**

Using native web components to create encapsulated microfrontends.

## When to Use Microfrontends

### ✅ **Use when:**

- Large teams working on different parts of the application
- Need for technology diversity across teams
- Independent deployment requirements
- Complex domain boundaries

### ❌ **Avoid when:**

- Small teams or simple applications
- Tight coupling between different parts
- Performance is critical
- Limited resources for managing complexity

## Real-World Example

```typescript
// E-commerce platform with microfrontends
class EcommercePlatform {
  private shell: AppShell;
  private microfrontends: {
    catalog: ProductCatalogMicrofrontend;
    cart: ShoppingCartMicrofrontend;
    profile: UserProfileMicrofrontend;
  };

  constructor() {
    this.shell = new AppShell();
    this.initializeMicrofrontends();
  }

  private initializeMicrofrontends() {
    this.shell.registerMicrofrontend(
      "catalog",
      new ProductCatalogMicrofrontend()
    );
    this.shell.registerMicrofrontend("cart", new ShoppingCartMicrofrontend());
    this.shell.registerMicrofrontend("profile", new UserProfileMicrofrontend());
  }

  navigateToSection(section: string) {
    const container = document.getElementById("main-content");
    this.shell.renderMicrofrontend(section, container);
  }
}
```

Microfrontends provide a powerful approach to building large-scale frontend applications by enabling team autonomy, technology diversity, and independent deployment while maintaining a cohesive user experience.
